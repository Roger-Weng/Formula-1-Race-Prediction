# Formula-1-Race-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to predict Formula 1 race results with a high degree of
accuracy. Specifically, we aim to answer two key questions:
1. Which drivers are likely to finish on the podium, securing a top-three position in a given race? (binary classification)
2. Can we predict the exact finishing position of each driver in a Formula 1 race? (multiclass classification)

First, download the four CSV files. 
Then, in the .ipynb file, go to the "Loading data" section and change the file paths to the locations where you have stored the CSV files on your computer. After this, you can proceed to run the notebook.
