# Formula-1-Race-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to predict Formula 1 race results with a high degree of
accuracy. Specifically, we aim to answer two key questions:
1. Which drivers are likely to finish on the podium, securing a top-three position in a given race? (binary classification)
2. Can we accurately predict the finishing position of each driver in a Formula 1 race? (multiclass classification)
